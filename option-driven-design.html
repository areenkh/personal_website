    <p><strong>Fig 1:</strong> In “Option-Driven Design,” users must
    interact with options and settings for systems to adapt to their needs.
    This approach places the burden on both the user and the system to make
    the interaction <em>between</em> user and system fit. The user must know
    and find which options they need and then adjust them. In addition, the
    system must be capable of robust change, similar to system change in
    <em>ability-based design.</em></p>
    <h2 id="what-is-option-driven-design-odd">1. What is Option-Driven
    Design (ODD)?</h2>
    <p>Option-driven design is a design strategy to present users with
    options for manipulating the default logic and presentation of an
    interface system, such as through the adjustment of settings and
    preferences. Generally, when a user changes system state in this way,
    their chosen options or preferences are not overridden and will persist
    throughout other interactions (and even be inherited by other systems).
    ODD is often used in the context of software applications such as games,
    desktop and mobile operating systems, and internet browsers.</p>
    <p>While ODD as a practice has been ubiquitous in computing systems for
    decades, an examination of ODD from the perspective of accessibility and
    its impacts is overdue. The immediate intention of this paper is to
    provide clarity to designers who are considering whether, why, and how
    to use ODD in a system. The broader intention of this paper is to
    stimulate new research, conversations, technical solutions, and ideas
    related to options and accessibility.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-context-of-accessibility-option-driven-design">2.
    What is the context of accessibility &amp; Option-Driven Design?</h2>
    <p>In contemporary accessible computing practices, designers and
    developers navigate complex design tensions, building systems that are
    assumed to fit to different user abilities. This practice of a designer
    engaging their own (and a system’s) “ability assumptions” in regard to
    accessibility comes from the existing work of Wobbrock et al [14]. In
    the design space around ability assumptions, a designer recognizes that
    a system may have been built with assumptions about a user’s abilities
    (such as the user’s sight, motor functions, and more). For example, a
    trackpad or mouse is built with the assumption that the input it
    receives is from a user’s hand and fingers, which are assumed to operate
    in the same way according to normative expectations that the designer
    has. The designer assumes all users have hands and fingers, all of which
    also operate in the same way.</p>
    <p>These assumptions create problems for users (see Fig 2). When users
    must adapt to a system’s assumptions, the burden of interaction is
    placed on the user. Users compensate in a variety of ways to fill the
    gaps left by a designer’s assumptions, using different body parts,
    augmentations, or behaviors than the designer expected. Wobbrock et al
    propose that systems should recognize and adapt to a user’s abilities,
    instead. This approach allows users to interact however they want, and
    it is up to the system to recognize whether it needs to change and do so
    accordingly.</p>
    <p>But what about systems that don’t have awareness or when an automatic
    adaptation could produce more barriers or unwanted changes?</p>
    <p><img src="./images/projects/ability-based-design.jpeg"

    <p><strong>Fig 2</strong>: (Wobbrock et al’s figure [13]) User abilities
    and a system's ability assumptions: (a) user abilities match a system's
    ability assumptions; (b) in assistive technology, the user acquires an
    adaptation to remedy a mismatch; and (c) in ability-based design, user
    abilities drive changes in the system.</p>
    <h3
    id="automatically-adapting-systems-are-not-always-an-appropriate-design-choice">2.1
    Automatically-adapting systems are not always an appropriate design
    choice</h3>
    <p>In cases where one user’s fit is another user’s barrier (which we
    call <em>access friction</em> [6]), systems must be able to adapt.
    Ability-based design proposes that systems could have sensory awareness
    and a degree of decision-making or intelligence. These systems would
    sense the user, their behavior, or their environment and adapt
    <em>automatically</em> to a perceived interaction barrier.</p>
    <p>But many computing contexts lack the hardware capabilities to detect
    a user’s body and interaction patterns. In addition, some contexts (such
    as the web) are standardized to protect the privacy of assistive
    technology users and obfuscate or hide which input devices are used
    through layers of abstraction [8]. Programmatic detection of the user’s
    body and abilities is seen as a potential privacy and security issue for
    many reasons. To further this problem space, some adaptations a system
    makes automatically may even produce additional or unwanted barriers or
    features without the user’s consent.</p>
    <p>In addition, there are also important social and contextual factors
    that could influence the needs of a user or users who are interacting
    with a technology that simply cannot or should not be part of a system’s
    design considerations. In particular, there may be cases where users are
    collaboratively or <em>interdependently</em> interacting with a
    technology and their social dynamic is the place where access friction
    is negotiated, not the system [1]. Even in perfect hardware and software
    conditions, automatic adaptation may not be produce sufficient or ideal
    outcomes.</p>
    <h3 id="options-should-not-compensate-for-inaccessible-design">2.2
    Options should not compensate for inaccessible design</h3>
    <p>The rise of accessibility options in video games in particular in the
    past 2 years has led to debates on social media about whether options
    should be seen as award-worthy design on their own or not [10]. I am
    writing in agreement with what Grant Stoner, Morgan Baker, Mila Pavlin,
    Ian Hamilton (and others) have already written about in terms of games
    to remark on broader computing contexts as well: While
    accessible-by-design is not sufficient by itself, options should not be
    used to compensate for a design that was inaccessible by default. The
    perspective that these accessibility folks from the gaming industry have
    about games is also applicable to many other computing contexts.</p>
    <p>ODD has strong advantages when accessible designs for one user may
    end up producing cognitive, functional, or presentational barriers for
    another user. However, expecting users to navigate access friction
    between a design’s default settings and their needs and preferences on
    their own behalf has limitations.</p>
    <p>In systems that are inaccessible, burden is placed on the user to
    adapt to the system’s ability assumptions. In ability-based design, the
    burden is placed on the system to adapt to the user. But where is the
    burden in ODD?</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the burden is bi-directional in option-driven design
    (see Fig 1). In an ODD approach, the system must still be capable of
    change. This means that a system must be designed to be technically
    robust, allowing for different inputs, outputs, logic, flow, processes,
    and more. However, assuming users know which accessibility settings they
    need, how to find them, and how given options help address the barriers
    that exist in a system is a significant burden.</p>
    <p>In an ODD approach, users must be able to know, either during the use
    of the system or before using it, that something about the system is not
    only insufficient but also <em>can</em> be changed. In my own
    professional work, I often find that most users not only assume that
    systems cannot be changed but are already so used to having to adapt to
    systems that they are not willing to find and manipulate system settings
    unless they intend to use the system long enough or already know that a
    given system can be adjusted.</p>
    <p>Option-driven design often has findability and understandability
    burdens to overcome, in addition to costing a user time and
    patience.</p>
    <h2 id="design-considerations-tradeoffs">3. Design Considerations &amp;
    Tradeoffs</h2>
    <p>The following section engages important tradeoffs for designers to
    weigh when considering an <em>options-driven design</em> approach.</p>
    <h3 id="time-of-use-is-a-key-variable">3.1 Time-of-use is a key
    variable</h3>
    <p>How long will a user interact with a system? Just one hour total,
    like a webpage? One hour every day, perhaps like an email interface? A
    few hours a day, like an internet browser? Or constantly, like a desktop
    or mobile operating system? The time a user is expected to spend
    occupying a given system is one of the most important considerations
    when choosing whether ODD is an appropriate approach.</p>
    <h4 id="long-use-contexts">3.1.1 Long-use contexts</h4>
    <p>When the context is a mobile or desktop operating system, the
    decision to have a few options provided has more worth to the time
    investment of a user. This is especially true if all applications and
    additional software within that system also inherit the same settings
    (which presently is enforced better in some ecosystems, to put it
    lightly).</p>
    <p>Applications that might occupy a significant and regular amount of
    time for a user, such as a social media app or an app used for the sake
    of income or employment, the benefit of adjusting options may be worth
    the user’s time as well.</p>
    <h4 id="medium-use-contexts">3.1.2 Medium-use contexts</h4>
    <p>Video games, currently an industry that commands more revenue than
    all of film and music combined [12], occupies a middle ground for ODD
    when considering time-of-use. A triple-A (AAA) game may expect to occupy
    a player’s time from anywhere between 10 and 400 hours (or more).
    Despite this wide range of use, some award-winning AAA games have more
    than 60 accessibility settings [9] while others which are still lauded
    for their accessibility by their players have literally none at all
    [11]. All games benefit from being accessible by design, but no two
    games offer the same value to a player for the same option.</p>
    <p>Another important consideration for games specifically is that
    options navigate an essential tension in games between accessibility and
    difficulty. Ian Hamilton explains that because games hinge on overcoming
    challenges, any options at all interact with the challenges the user
    experiences [3]. So for games, finding that ideal experience that
    doesn’t block users from playing but still provides a sense of challenge
    is key to the design process. Other contexts by comparison, such as
    websites or operating systems, should not strive to be difficult at
    all.</p>
    <h4 id="section"></h4>
    <h4 id="section-1"></h4>
    <h4 id="short-use-contexts">3.1.3 Short-use contexts</h4>
    <p>On the other end of the spectrum of ODD and time-of-use are websites.
    Websites are an example of a context where ODD is not only rarely worth
    a user’s time, but also goes against the philosophy of web accessibility
    (which expects accessibility by default) [4].</p>
    <p>Overlay solutions (which are not only riddled with lawsuits and
    technical barriers [2]) largely rely on an ODD approach: users are
    expected to adjust accessibility settings (such as contrast, text size,
    and animations) on their own every time they visit a new webpage that
    uses an overlay. In addition to this, overlays don’t share settings for
    the same user across sites that use the same overlay, don’t inherit
    higher level settings (for large font or high contrast) from the
    operating system or browser, and have no standard for sharing their
    settings with other overlay venders.</p>
    <p>Largely, ODD has become a time-consuming expense for users with
    disabilities on the web and primarily absolves website owners and
    maintainers from pursuing an accessible-by-design approach in the first
    place (it is often the selling point of an overlay that it can “make
    your website accessible” with a single line of code).</p>
    <h3 id="modularity-extensibility-are-also-options">3.2 Modularity &amp;
    extensibility are also options</h3>
    <p>The customizability and modular nature of some games or software,
    such Visual Studio Code or Bethesda’s Fallout and Skyrim, are closely
    related to option-driven design. With ability assumptions, a designer
    does not expect user adaptations. With ability-based design, the design
    expects specific adaptations and provides a way for the system to adapt
    automatically. With option-driven design, the designer expects specific
    adaptations and provides a means for the <em>user</em> to enact those on
    the system. Modularity and extensibility is a type of option-driven
    design, except that the designer does not expect specific adaptations
    but instead provides a means for users themselves to identify and adapt
    the system. In addition, modular systems also often provide a way for
    users to share their adaptations with others. In this sense, the burden
    in this model is placed on the system, users, <em>and</em> community
    members and infrastructure.</p>
    <p>But for users who aren’t community contributors, their experience of
    the options available to them are similar to designer-curated options,
    except that the documentation, functionality, and maintenance of a given
    option are determined by the community instead or the system’s dedicated
    or core designers.</p>
    <p>VS Code as a software is built with reasonable core defaults (as well
    as some pre-determined options) but can also be almost wholly customized
    through community-contributed extensions (and is designed to encourage
    users to do this).</p>
    <p>However, it is essential to note that extensions and mods built by
    community members that are used for accessibility purposes, such as
    Chrome’s Dark Reader, pose important questions about who should be
    responsible for the accessibility of a system, whether it is ethical for
    software designers to rely on community-<em>designed</em> extensions,
    and whether software builders should rely on
    community-<em>maintained</em> extensions.</p>
    <p>As an example, World of Warcraft’s most competitive and difficult
    content has arguably been intentionally designed around the expectation
    that players will continue to be able to use a mod that is built and
    maintained by a single person [7]. It may not be ethical for software,
    after recognizing their access barriers, to expect that the community
    continues to maintain ways to navigate those barriers.</p>
    <h3
    id="inheritable-options-can-take-some-of-the-burden-away-from-the-user">3.3
    Inheritable options can take some of the burden away from the user</h3>
    <p>In closed ecosystems, like Apple’s for example, accessibility
    settings propagate between systems and are inherited by centralized,
    set-once-and-forget accessibility options. The iPhone alone has dozens
    of accessibility settings that influence the entire interaction design
    of applications. This is an ideal example.</p>
    <p>However, generally systems that scale struggle to provide solutions
    that can also accommodate and fit user’s needs and preferences [5]. Many
    ecosystems lack standards for interoperability. Video games in
    particular do not have persistence in settings across new games. Players
    must continually search for and set their options again with every new
    game they play, and many games do not offer a standard or similar set of
    options. In addition, since accessibility overlays on websites are
    intended to serve the design of the website by default and not the user,
    must have contrast, text size, and other options set every time a user
    visits a new site. Overlay vendors do not share a user’s settings with
    one another (and should not for the sake of their privacy) but also
    don’t inherit higher levels of settings that a user specifies, such as
    using Windows High Contrast mode.</p>
    <p>But with the apparent demand for ODD’s advantages in ideal settings,
    helping users navigate access friction and contexts where their needs
    cannot and should not be known, it is important for technical standards
    for interoperability to arise within specific domains. Video games may
    not benefit from standardized elements and semantics at an individual
    game level, but likely could benefit from standardization at the level
    of a console or operating system. Websites also are a context where
    there should be more standardization to inherit both browser-level and
    operating system-level user settings.</p>
    <p>By working towards inheritability and solutions that can create more
    fluid adaptations, we can retain many of the advantages of an ODD
    approach while also still relieving the burdens placed on users.</p>
    <h2 id="discussion-suggestions">4. Discussion &amp; Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Option-driven design as a strategy for accessibility has been sorely
    under-discussed in academic circles, especially. And with the rise of
    both accessibility in games and overlays for websites, knowing when to
    suggest ODD and when to avoid it is still a murky space for designers. I
    hope that this micro-paper primarily serves to do a few things:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p>Invigorate research attention to look at how users with
    disabilities interact with systems in different contexts to get a better
    sense of when ODD is an appropriate choice, despite the burden placed on
    a user.</p></li>
    <li><p>Stimulate a technical conversation around standardizing
    <em>inheritable</em> options in ecosystems like game consoles, so that
    users don’t have to re-specify the same settings with every new
    game.</p></li>
    <li><p>Push designers and the general public to critically engage
    contexts where ODD is used to enable bad design practices, such as
    overlays on websites or in applications that are not accessible by
    default.</p></li>
    <li><p>Imagine new paradigms for design that allow more users more
    persistent control and dynamic expressiveness over their experiences.
    (In what contexts might users want to be their <em>own</em> designers
    and how can we shape technology to serve their goals?)</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>There is a sweet spot for option-driven design that must be carefully
    considered. Everyone, from researchers, engineers, designers,
    accessibility practitioners, to players and users, should be able to
    recognize the tradeoffs and considerations of option-driven design. As a
    nearly ubiquitous interaction design pattern in computing, it has risen
    in popularity to both solve legitimate problems posed by complex
    interactive systems and as a band-aid that enables poor design practices
    to continue.</p>
    <p>It is important to look into the future and treat option-driven
    design as just one strategy among many that can be employed when
    engaging accessibility. It is, after all, just an <em>option</em>. And
    it is one that should be considered carefully.</p>
