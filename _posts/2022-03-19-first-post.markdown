As a millennial, most of my childhood is not recorded in digital photos but in videos on VHS tapes and photos albums that my parents have. I like flipping through digital photos and so I decided that it's time to get all the pictures into digital form. Now the question is how? In this post I am showing that a simple flatbed scanner and some open source command line tools (Fred's ImageMagick Scripts, ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick, Parallel, Exiftool, and standard UNIX tools) are fast and produce good quality images.
