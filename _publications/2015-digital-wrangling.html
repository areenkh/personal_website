Research in the humanities tends to focus on individual accomplishment, creating a bias of centrality to the work of individuals while neglecting possibly influential peripheral figures. Networks of material letters have begun as a new object of study in the digital humanities, but often the purpose of visualization research is not clearly understood and implemented, and the underlying research questions are not clearly posed. This research addresses these problems through case-studies (the collected letters of Robert Southey, Willa Cather, and Samuel Beckett), careful documentations of procedures and tools, and thorough consideration of interpretative issues surrounding visualization in the humanities. Gephi and D3 offered the most user-friendly platforms to produce interactive networks of letters, while a variety of formats and languages were used to translate and aggregate the data. The iterative process of hypothesis forming through visualization and differential reading was found to be an effective method of research. The researchers concluded that visualizations of early 19th to 20th century letters revealed insight regarding the relationships and patterns of the subjects of our case studies. The implications for this research are broad because the methods and technologies of data aggregation and visualization in the field are not yet formalized. This research could be improved upon and extended to a wide range of writers and public figures in the 19th and 20th centuries.
