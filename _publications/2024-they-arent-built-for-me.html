Our study, inspired by the seminal work of Cleveland and McGill, investigates the perceptual accuracy of blind or visually impaired individuals when interpreting tactile representations of graphical data. By replicating and extending this foundational research, we aim to shed light on the efficacy of tactile displays for conveying complex datasets.
