In Option-Driven Design, users must interact with options and settings for systems to adapt to their needs. This approach places the burden on both the user and the system to make the interaction between user and system fit. The user must know and find which options they need and then adjust them. In addition, the system must be capable of robust change, similar to system change in ability-based design. In this micro-paper I outline the context for option-driven design, followed by several design negotiations, tradeoffs, and suggestions worth considering with this approach.
