Our study, inspired by the seminal work of Cleveland and McGill, investigates the perceptual accuracy of blind and low vision individuals when interpreting tactile representations of graphical data. By replicating and extending this foundational research, we aim to shed light on the efficacy of tactile displays for conveying complex datasets, collect a set of strategies adapted by users, and come up with a set of design guidelines for tactile graphics.
