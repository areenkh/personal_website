# Hi, I'm Frank Elavsky

<div class="columns" markdown="1">

<div class="intro" markdown="1">
I research, design, build, contribute to standards, and talk about things at the intersection of data work and accessibility.

I'm a PhD student and researcher at the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), some mix of contractor/intern doing data interaction research at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) <i class="fab fa-apple"></i>, and senior research scientist at [Fizz Studio](https://fizz.studio/).

At CMU, I am advised by Dominik Moritz and Patrick Carrington and a member of the [Data Interaction Group](https://dig.cmu.edu/) and [AXLE Lab](https://axle-lab.com/). I am also a [W3C invited expert in data visualization in the ARIA Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/aria/participants#:~:text=Frank%20Elavsky) and volunteer my time with [other efforts](https://github.com/dataviza11y/Why-We-Exist).

## My background

<div class="intro" markdown="1">

Before embarking on a PhD I was a staff design systems engineer at Visa on their Data Experience team and lead contributor to the accessibility efforts of their first open source library, [Visa Chart Components](https://github.com/visa/visa-chart-components). We were able to do some pretty extraordinary things together and I am fortunate to have worked alongside such world-class folks. Having the chance to contribute to the accessibility of one of the only design systems projects out there was a stupendous opportunity.

Prior to Visa I had a high-octane 2 years at Northwestern University working for Research Computing Services providing data visualization support to over two dozen research projects across a wide range of disciplines. Several of my projects [won awards](https://www.frank.computer/cv/#awards) and have been featured in over 60 research publications (including the privilege of being uncredited in the [2017 Nobel Lecture on Physics](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.90.040502)), 100+ web articles, 4 PhD theses, 4 graduate courses, and [9 textbooks](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Frank+elavsky%22&hl=en&tbm=bks&sxsrf=APq-WBuA3-rFi5BAWgvu7rf_ax78Iee66w:1648824562316&ei=8hBHYsf-Eu-FytMPsZ-B0AI&start=0&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwjHv9WSjvP2AhXvgnIEHbFPACo4ChDy0wN6BAgBED0&biw=896&bih=931&dpr=2).

In my early career (before Northwestern), I worked in federal policy analyzing large, complex medicare/medicaid datasets and building visualization tools for lawyers and policymakers.
