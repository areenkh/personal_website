# Hi, I'm Areen Khalaila

<div class="columns" markdown="1">
<div class="intro" markdown="1">
I research, design, and engineer solutions at the intersection of accessibility and technology.

I just completed a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with a minor in Physics, at [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/) with highest honors. I was advised by Prof. [Dylan Cashman](https://dylancashman.github.io) as part of the BraVa lab . My senior honors thesis, titled "From Touch to Insight: Exploring Tactile Strategies and Design Guidelines for Non-Visual Graphical Perception," explored visual perception studies with tactile representations of data for visually impaired users. Throughout my time at Brandies, I have received several awards, which you can find in my [CV](https://areenkh.com/cv/).

I was formerly a research intern at the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I conducted research under the guidance of [Patrick Carrington](https://www.patrickcarrington.com/) and Franklin Mingzhi Li, using form factor cameras to enhance cooking experiences for visually impaired individuals.

Outside of research, I was a teaching assistant (TA) for different Computer Science courses, ranging from introductory classes to more advances ones, every semester since freshamn year. I also led both small and big classes as a head TA. I served as a mentor for first-gen students, offering them academic support.

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email at first name kh at brandeis dot edu or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/areenkh). Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/areenkh).

<!-- ## My background

<div class="intro" markdown="1">

In 2021, I came to the United States as an international student to pursue an undergraduate degree at [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/) in the Boston area. My passion for computer science began in eighth grade, learning to code in C# and later expanding into web development with ASP.NET. Recognizing my achievements, Brandeis awarded me a prestigious full-ride scholarship, which is given to 1 student every 4 years.

Thanks to my strong coding background, I became a teaching assistant in my first year at Brandeis. I am now a Head Teaching Assistant and lead weekly recitations while managing grading tasks and coordinating with other TAs.

At the Brandeis Visual Analytics Lab, under the guidance of Professor Dylan Cashman, we work on research focusing on visual perception studies with tactile data for visually impaired users. Additionally, I am a student researcher at the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). At the AXLE Lab, under the guidance of [Patrick Carrington](https://www.patrickcarrington.com/), I research assistive technology to enhance cooking experiences for visually impaired individuals. -->
