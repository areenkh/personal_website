  <!-- This study explores the effectiveness of various camera form factors to assist visually impaired individuals with kitchen tasks. Through pilot testing and participant feedback, we examine which camera systems provide the most support in activities such as measuring ingredients, monitoring food doneness, and identifying objects, with the goal of enhancing usability and safety in kitchen environments. -->
